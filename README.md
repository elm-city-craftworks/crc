# CRC Visualization Tool

This is a very rough attempt at providing a digital representation of 
Class-Responsibility-Collaborator cards, as described in
[A Laboratory for Teaching Object-Oriented Thinking](http://c2.com/doc/oopsla89/paper.html)
(Cunningham/Beck OOPSLA 89).

This is an experimental project, and isn't necessarily useful yet.
But feel free to play around with it!

## Usage

1. Run `bundle install`
2. Run `ruby bin/crc example/atm.txt atm.pdf`
3. Experiment with creating your own input files!
